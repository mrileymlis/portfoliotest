## ABOUT ME
I am a graduate student at UCLA completing my Master's in Library and Information Science; my areas of focus are labor issues - especially precarious labor - in LIS, archives, and special collections.

## ABOUT MY PORTFOLIO
This portfolio is a collection of papers completed over my two years in the MLIS program. There are research papers, white papers, and other projects included in the portfolio.
