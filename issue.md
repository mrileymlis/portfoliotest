title: ISSUE SUMMARY AND PAPER
permalink: /issue/

Precarious labor, also sometimes referred to as contigent, temporary, or contract labor, has quickly become the norm for positions in libraries, archives, and other information and memory institutions over recent years. This shift from stable, full-time positions to positions that are short-term contract-based and often without benefits has drastically altered and undermined the professional LIS workforce. Using the grievance filed by UC-AFT on behalf of six temporary archivists at UCLA and its context as a case study, I examine how contingent labor and its precarity negatively impacts workers, institutions, and the libraries and archives fields as a whole.
